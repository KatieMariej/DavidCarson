 <h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
    
<body>
<p>In this essay, I will explore how David Carson’s unconventional style impacted and influenced visual communication in the1990s. During this time Carson became a highly prominent Graphic Designer who produced innovative typography methods and untraditional design techniques which he used to communicate and provoke emotion to convey the meanings behind his work. </p>

<p>Carson is widely well known for his work at Ray Gun magazine where his unconventional and experimental style fitted in very well with the magazine's alternative aesthetic. </p>

<p>Carson’s unorthodox style was controversial to many traditional designers. Particularly the fact he often did not concern himself with things being immediately legible upon first glance, noting that not everything that is legible necessarily communicates much or even grabs peoples’ emotional understanding. </p>

<p>However, he appealed to the younger audience, particularly inspiring the new generation of designers, and representing the grunge movement of the 1990s. He even designed covers for 1990s grunge band Nine Inch Nails in his signature style, using an image from an old rusty bomb shelter located in his back garden for one of the albums. He also created an advertisement for surf brand Quicksilver using minimal type and a series of photographs.(Carson) </p>

<h2 id="education">EDUCATION AND CAREER</h2>

<p>David Carson was born in Texas on the 8 September 1954 but grew up in California. He attended San Diego State University to study Sociology. After his time at San Diego State, he shifted his focus and studied at the Oregon College of Commercial Art where he started studying Graphic Design. After finishing his studies at the Oregon College of Commercial Art, Carson then became a Sociology teacher in California. It was during this time that he found his passion for competitive surfing and was ranked eighth in the world.(Edson)</p>

<p>In 1984 David Carson was offered an Art Director position at Transworld Skateboarding magazine. During this time, he started to discover and develop his signature style which included unconventional type and photographic techniques which will be explained in more detail later in the essay.(Edson) </p>

<p>In 1989 Carson started to work for Beach Culture magazine, a Surfer magazine. This publication only lasted 6 quarterly issues. However, he still gained recognition from his short time at this company as he won 150 design awards from his work on the magazine.(magCulture)</p>

<p>Carson then went on to work for Ray Gun magazine in 1992 as an Art Director. Ray Gun was an alternative music magazine that attracted wide readership. During his time at the magazine, Carson was a pioneer of contemporary design techniques which included layered images, distorted text, and distressed textures. He used strong type and bold colours alongside rough asymmetric letters and images to convey the message of his work which was particularly appealing to younger readers.(Carson and Blackwell)</p>

<p>He also worked on a Quicksilver printed advert which purpose was to lead young consumers to websites with the use of print advertising, using traditional methods to guide readers to a modern platform as a new normal and a convenient way to get consumers online. The possibility of visual communication increased enormously as consumers could access the growing technology of the World Wide Web.(Carson) </p>

<h2 id="breaking design">BREAKING TRADITIONAL DESIGN RULES</h2>

<p>In the 1990s modernism heavily influenced graphic design. David Carson’s experimental style was remarkably different. He often went against traditional design principles including grid structure and hierarchy and instead he focused on communicating through his designs. Carson wanted to emotionally engage with the viewer through his work. This is a particularly crucial point to mention as this was unlike many designers at the time and brought a new perspective to visual communication. (Carson and Blackwell)</p>

<p>Carson’s design style was incredibly unique to him and different from the modernist style many designers were using during this time. His designs were often chaotic, he experimented with distorting typefaces, no use of grids, negative space, layering, collages, and asymmetrical layouts. </p>

<p>This change from modernist design is another reason his style impacted visual communication during the 1990s. He wanted to evoke feelings with his work not just logical responses, for example, he wanted the audience to understand the emotions of grunge youth culture and music as a feeling of its own. Rather than following traditional structure design rules, he offered something which was more of a suggestion sparking the feeling of the viewer to decide for themselves that this was something they wanted to explore more.(Carson and Blackwell) </p>

<h2 id="typography">TYPOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>David Carson’s use of typography is a very important aspect of his design as he had a unique ‘grunge’ typographic style which earned him the nickname ‘the father of Grunge’. </p>

<p>The grunge style was messy and layered and the emerging style came from the British Punk scene. A good example of this emerging aesthetic was the curation of the Sex Pistols whose album cover and typeface was designed by Jamie Reid. (Sweeting) </p>

<p>During the grunge era, Carson developed his unique style and would often distort, manipulate, and distress typefaces. He deviated from precise typefaces and instead, adopted a relaxed hand-drawn approach. This was vastly different in comparison to other designers who were inclined to focus on using type faces to enhance the readability and the structure of their designs. (Heller and Ballance)</p>

<h2 id="impact">IMPACT ON CORPORATIONS</h2>
<p>David Carson had a positive impact on young people from that era. His design work at Ray Gun particularly appealed to the younger readers of this magazine resulting in the circulation of the magazine trippling over three years.</p>

<p>In 1995, Carson left Ray Gun and formed his own design company called David Carson Design. Carson’s success at Ray Gun attracted large corporations such as Nike, Pepsi, Ray Ban, Budweiser, Microsoft, and Levi Strauss.  These corporations hired him to work on their branding in an attempt to appeal to the younger people and, in particular, the grunge generation.</p>

<p>Carson’s unique, original style resulted in changing the visual language of advertising and helped increase relatability and likability for these corporate brands. He was instrumental in helping many companies, in particular Microsoft, appeal to younger generations and make them relevant again.

<h2>IMPACT ON YOUNG DESIGNERS</h2>
<p>David Carson’s deconstructionist style shook the graphic design world and caused much controversy, not just attracting, but also repelling a lot of traditional designers. Some people thought his design work was fractured and misleading and they felt he did not take his work seriously.(“David Carson: The Accidental Revolutionary Who Gave Graphic Design a Punk Makeover.”)</p>

<p>However, Carson had a remarkable influence on young designers in the 1990s. He inspired up-and-coming designers to break away from traditional design principles, to experiment with new techniques and encouraged them to develop their own signature style. This changed how young designers approached their work and resulted in an increase, particularly in the grunge aesthetic, and new innovative layouts which transformed the design world at that time.(“Graphic Giants: David Carson | Sessions College.”) He helped design a humorous campaign on smoke free environments showing he was not afraid to include humour in his work. (Carson) </p>

<p>Carson’s advice to young people starting out in the design world was to carry your own unique intuition, up bringing and experience to your work because it is something that cannot be taught or replicated. (Carson)</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Overall, David Carson had an impact and influence on many aspects of visual communication in the 1990s. </p>

<p>Interestingly, David Carson came late to the world of graphic design. He studied Graphic Design at University. However, he did not initially follow a creative career path and instead went into the teaching profession for 7 years. I believe this had a huge impact on his design as he developed his own style instead of using traditional design principles or following the modernist movement of the 90s which may have happened if he had joined the design world straight out of college. </p>

<p>Carson was a pioneer of design techniques breaking many traditional design principles and instead experimented with innovative typography. He developed his own unique style which was different from designers at that time. This gave him a sense of individuality as his style was unique, intuitive, and emotive. Carson particularly wanted to emotionally engage with the viewer through his work and evoke feelings, not just logical responses, and this was a highly innovative approach and gave a new perspective to visual communication.</p>

<p>Carson’s design work for large corporations changed the visual language of advertising particularly appealing to young people enabling these brands to increase their relatability and making them more relevant as well as opening the doors to visual communication increasing on the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Carson had a positive influence on a new generation of young experimental designers partly due to his unique grunge typographic style that gave him the nickname ‘Father of Grunge’ but also encouraging them to break away from traditional design principles and inspiring them to branch out into new techniques and develop their own signature style and aesthetics. This paved the way for a continuation of innovative design for visual communication into the future.</p>

<p>David Carson’s unconventional style impacted and influenced visual communication during the 1990s and beyond. This influence was particularly seen in the media and in advertising. People are still inspired by Carson’s work at the present day, and this impact is still evident today in the design of posters, album covers, social media, magazines and digital art. Due to Carson’s use of innovative typography methods, new techniques such as his grunge innovative style, use of chaotic backgrounds and the fact he was unafraid to experiment and take the risks to break free from convention; in the true spirit of Grunge, he remains an inspiring figure in this field. </p>
